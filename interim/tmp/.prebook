O loveliness fugitive!  \nWhose glance has so suddenly caused me again to live,  \nShall I not see you again till this life is o'er!  \n\nElsewhere, far away ... too late, perhaps never more,  \nFor I know not whither you fly, nor you, where I go,  \nO soul that I would have loved, and _that_ you know!</code>"
