<body> <h3 id="benediction">Benediction</h3>
<pre><code>When by the changeless Power of a Supreme Decree  
The poet issues forth upon this sorry sphere,  
His mother, horrified, and full of blasphemy,  
Uplifts her voice to God, who takes compassion on her.  

&quot;Ah, why did I not bear a serpent&#39;s nest entire,  
Instead of bringing forth this hideous Child of Doom!  
Oh curs�d be that transient night of vain desire  
When I conceived my expiation in my womb!&quot;  

&quot;Yet since among all women thou hast chosen me  
To be the degradation of my jaded mate,  
And since I cannot like a love-leaf wantonly  
Consign this stunted monster to the glowing grate,&quot;  

&quot;I&#39;ll cause thine overwhelming hatred to rebound  
Upon the curs�d tool of thy most wicked spite.  
Forsooth, the branches of this wretched tree I&#39;ll wound  
And rob its pestilential blossoms of their might!&quot;  

So thus, she giveth vent unto her foaming ire,  
And knowing not the changeless statutes of all times,  
Herself, amid the flames of hell, prepares the pyre;  
The consecrated penance of maternal crimes.  

Yet &#39;neath th&#39; invisible shelter of an Angel&#39;s wing  
This sunlight-loving infant disinherited,  
Exhales from all he eats and drinks, and everything  
The ever sweet ambrosia and the nectar red.  

He trifles with the winds and with the clouds that glide,  
About the way unto the Cross, he loves to sing,  
The spirit on his pilgrimage; that faithful guide,  
Oft weeps to see him joyful like a bird of Spring.  

All those that he would cherish shrink from him with fear,  
And some that waxen bold by his tranquility,  
Endeavour hard some grievance from his heart to tear,  
And make on him the trial of their ferocity.  

Within the bread and wine outspread for his repast  
To mingle dust and dirty spittle they essay,  
And everything he touches, forth they slyly cast,  
Or scourge themselves, if e&#39;er their feet betrod his way.  

His wife goes round proclaiming in the crowded quads—  
&quot;Since he can find my body beauteous to behold,  
Why not perform the office of those ancient gods  
And like unto them, redeck myself with shining gold?&quot;  

&quot;I&#39;ll bathe myself with incense, spikenard and myrrh,  
With genuflexions, delicate viandes and wine,  
To see, in jest, if from a heart, that loves me dear,  
I cannot filch away the hommages divine.&quot;  

&quot;And when of these impious jokes at length I tire,  
My frail but mighty hands, around his breast entwined,  
With nails, like harpies&#39; nails, shall cunningly conspire  
The hidden path unto his feeble heart to find.&quot;  

&quot;And like a youngling bird that trembles in its nest,  
I&#39;ll pluck his heart right out; within its own blood drowned,  
And finally to satiate my favourite beast,  
I&#39;ll throw it with intense disdain upon the ground!&quot;  

Towards the Heavens where he sees the sacred grail  
The poet calmly stretches forth his pious arms,  
Whereon the lightenings from his lucid spirit veil  
The sight of the infuriated mob that swarms.  

&quot;Oh blest be thou, Almighty who bestowest pain,  
Like some divine redress for our infirmities,  
And like the most refreshing and the purest rain,  
To sanctify the strong, for saintly ecstasies.&quot;  

&quot;I know that for the poet thou wilt grant a chair,  
Among the Sainted Legion and the Blissful ones,  
That of the endless feast thou wilt accord his share  
To him, of Virtues, Dominations and of Thrones.&quot;  

&quot;I know, that Sorrow is that nobleness alone,  
Which never may corrupted be by hell nor curse,  
I know, in order to enwreathe my mystic crown  
I must inspire the ages and the universe.&quot;  

&quot;And yet the buried jewels of Palmyra old,  
The undiscovered metals and the pearly sea  
Of gems, that unto me you show could never hold  
Beside this diadem of blinding brilliancy.&quot;  

&quot;For it shall be engendered from the purest fire  
Of rays primeval, from the holy hearth amassed,  
Of which the eyes of Mortals, in their sheen entire,  
Are but the tarnished mirrors, sad and overcast!&quot;</code></pre><hr>
<h3 id="echoes">Echoes</h3>
<pre><code>In Nature&#39;s temple, living columns rise,  
Which oftentimes give tongue to words subdued,  
And Man traverses this symbolic wood,  
Which looks at him with half familiar eyes,  

Like lingering echoes, which afar confound  
Themselves in deep and sombre unity,  
As vast as Night, and like transplendency,  
The scents and colours to each other respond.  

And scents there are, like infant&#39;s flesh as chaste,  
As sweet as oboes, and as meadows fair,  
And others, proud, corrupted, rich and vast,  

Which have the expansion of infinity,  
Like amber, musk and frankincense and myrrh,  
That sing the soul&#39;s and senses&#39; ecstasy.  </code></pre><hr>
<h3 id="the-sick-muse">The Sick Muse</h3>
<pre><code>Alas—my poor Muse—what aileth thee now?  
Thine eyes are bedimmed with the visions of Night,  
And silent and cold—I perceive on thy brow  
In their turns—Despair and Madness alight.  

A succubus green, or a hobgoblin red,  
Has it poured o&#39;er thee Horror and Love from its urn?  
Or the Nightmare with masterful bearing hath led  
Thee to drown in the depths of some magic Minturne?  

I wish, as the health-giving fragrance I cull,  
That thy breast with strong thoughts could for ever be full,  
And that rhymthmic&#39;ly flowing—thy Christian blood  

Could resemble the olden-time metrical-flood,  
Where each in his turn reigned the father of Rhymes  
Phoebus—and Pan, lord of Harvest-times.</code></pre><hr>
<h3 id="the-venal-muse">The Venal Muse</h3>
<pre><code>Oh Muse of my heart—so fond of palaces old,  
Wilt have—when New Year speeds its wintry blast,  
Amid those tedious nights, with snow o&#39;ercast,  
A log to warm thy feet, benumbed with cold?  

Wilt thou thy marbled shoulders then revive  
With nightly rays that through thy shutters peep?  
And—void thy purse and void thy palace—reap  
A golden hoard within some azure hive?  

Thou must, to earn thy daily bread, each night,  
Suspend the censer like an acolyte,  
Te-Deums sing, with sanctimonious ease,  

Or as a famished mountebank, with jokes obscene  
Essay to lull the vulgar rabble&#39;s spleen;  
Thy laughter soaked in tears which no one sees.</code></pre><hr>
<h3 id="the-evil-monk">The Evil Monk</h3>
<pre><code>The cloisters old, expounded on their walls  
With paintings, the Beatic Verity,  
The which—adorning their religious halls,  
Enriched the frigidness of their Austerity.  

In days when Christian seeds bloomed o&#39;er the land,  
Full many a noble monk unknown to-day,  
Upon the field of tombs would take his stand,  
Exalting Death in rude and simple way.  

My soul is a tomb where—bad monk that I be—  
I dwell and search its depths from all eternity,  
And nought bedecks the walls of the odious spot.  

Oh sluggard monk! when shall I glean aright  
From the living spectacle of my bitter lot,  
To mold my handywork and mine eyes&#39; Delight?</code></pre><hr>
<h3 id="the-enemy">The Enemy</h3>
<pre><code>My childhood was nought but a ravaging storm,  
Enlivened at times by a brilliant sun;  
The rain and the winds wrought such havoc and harm  
That of buds on my plot there remains hardly one.  

Behold now the Fall of ideas I have reached,  
And the shovel and rake one must therefore resume,  
In collecting the turf, inundated and breached,  
Where the waters dug trenches as deep as a tomb.  

And yet these new blossoms, for which I craved,  
Will they find in this earth—like a shore that is laved—  
The mystical fuel which vigour imparts?  

Oh misery!—Time devours our lives,  
And the enemy black, which consumeth our hearts  
On the blood of our bodies, increases and thrives!</code></pre><hr>
<h3 id="ill-luck">Ill Luck</h3>
<pre><code>This heavy burden to uplift,  
O Sysiphus, thy pluck is required!  
And even though the heart aspired,  
Art is long and Time is swift.  

Afar from sepulchres renowned,  
To a graveyard, quite apart,  
Like a broken drum, my heart,  
Beats the funeral marches&#39; sound.  

Many a buried jewel sleeps  
In the long-forgotten deeps,  
Far from mattock and from sound;  

Many a flower wafts aloft  
Its perfumes, like a secret soft,  
Within the solitudes, profound.</code></pre><hr>
<h3 id="interior-life">Interior Life</h3>
<pre><code>A long while I dwelt beneath vast porticoes,  
While the ocean-suns bathed with a thousand fires,  
And which with their great and majestic spires,  
At eventide looked like basaltic grottoes.  

The billows, in rolling depictured the skies,  
And mingled, in solemn and mystical strain,  
The all-mighteous chords of their luscious refrain  
With the sun-set&#39;s colours reflexed in mine eyes.  

It is there that I lived in exalted calm,  
In the midst of the azure, the splendour, the waves,  
While pregnant with perfumes, naked slaves  

Refreshed my forehead with branches of palm,  
Whose gentle and only care was to know  
The secret that caused me to languish so.</code></pre><hr>
<h3 id="man-and-the-sea">Man and the Sea</h3>
<pre><code>Free man! the sea is to thee ever dear!  
The sea is thy mirror, thou regardest thy soul  
In its mighteous waves that unendingly roll,  
And thy spirit is yet not a chasm less drear.  

Thou delight&#39;st to plunge deep in thine image down;  
Thou tak&#39;st it with eyes and with arms in embrace,  
And at times thine own inward voice would&#39;st efface  
With the sound of its savage ungovernable moan.  

You are both of you, sombre, secretive and deep:  
Oh mortal, thy depths are foraye unexplored,  
Oh sea—no one knoweth thy dazzling hoard,  
You both are so jealous your secrets to keep!  

And endless ages have wandered by,  
Yet still without pity or mercy you fight,  
So mighty in plunder and death your delight:  
Oh wrestlers! so constant in enmity!</code></pre><hr>
<h3 id="beauty">Beauty</h3>
<pre><code>I am lovely, O mortals, like a dream of stone,  
And my bosom, where each one gets bruised in turn,  
To inspire the love of a poet is prone,  
Like matter eternally silent and stern.  

As an unfathomed sphinx, enthroned by the Nile,  
My heart a swan&#39;s whiteness with granite combines,  
And I hate every movement, displacing the lines,  
And never I weep and never I smile.  

The poets in front of mine attitudes fine  
(Which the proudest of monuments seem to implant),  
To studies profound all their moments assign,  

For I have all these docile swains to enchant—  
Two mirrors, which Beauty in all things ignite:  
Mine eyes, my large eyes, of eternal Light!</code></pre><hr>
<h3 id="the-ideal">The Ideal</h3>
<pre><code>It could ne&#39;er be those beauties of ivory vignettes;  
The varied display of a worthless age,  
Nor puppet-like figures with castonets,  
That ever an heart like mine could engage.  

I leave to Gavarni, that poet of chlorosis,  
His hospital-beauties in troups that whirl,  
For I cannot discover amid his pale roses  
A flower to resemble my scarlet ideal.  

Since, what for this fathomless heart I require  
Is—Lady Macbeth you! in crime so dire;  
——An �schylus dream transposed from the South—  

Or thee, oh great &quot;Night&quot; of Michael-Angelo born,  
Who so calmly thy limbs in strange posture hath drawn,  
Whose allurements are framed for a Titan&#39;s mouth.</code></pre><hr>
<h3 id="the-giantess">The Giantess</h3>
<pre><code>I should have loved—erewhile when Heaven conceived  
Each day, some child abnormal and obscene,  
Beside a maiden giantess to have lived,  
Like a luxurious cat at the feet of a queen;  

To see her body flowering with her soul,  
And grow, unchained, in awe-inspiring art,  
Within the mists across her eyes that stole  
To divine the fires entombed within her heart.  

And oft to scramble o&#39;er her mighty limbs,  
And climb the slopes of her enormous knees,  
Or in summer when the scorching sunlight streams  

Across the country, to recline at ease,  
And slumber in the shadow of her breast  
Like an hamlet &#39;neath the mountain-crest.</code></pre><hr>
<h3 id="hymn-to-beauty">Hymn to Beauty</h3>
<pre><code>O Beauty! dost thou generate from Heaven or from Hell?  
Within thy glance, so diabolic and divine,  
Confusedly both wickedness and goodness dwell,  
And hence one might compare thee unto sparkling wine.  

Thy look containeth both the dawn and sunset stars,  
Thy perfumes, as upon a sultry night exhale,  
Thy kiss a philter, and thy mouth a Grecian vase,  
That renders heroes cowardly and infants hale.  

Yea, art thou from the planets, or the fiery womb?  
The demon follows in thy train, with magic fraught,  
Thou scatter&#39;st seeds haphazardly of joy and doom,  
Thou govern&#39;st everything, but answer&#39;st unto nought.  

O Loveliness! thou spurnest corpses with delight,  
Among thy jewels, Horror hath such charms for thee,  
And Murder &#39;mid thy mostly cherished trinklets bright,  
Upon thy massive bosom dances amorously.  

The blinded, fluttering moth towards the candle flies,  
Then frizzles, falls, and falters—&quot;Blessings unto thee&quot;—  
The panting swain that o&#39;er his beauteous mistress sighs,  
Seems like the Sick, that stroke their gravestones lovingly.  

What matter, if thou comest from the Heavens or Hell,  
O Beauty, frightful ghoul, ingenuous and obscure!  
So long thine eyes, thy smile, to me the way can tell  
Towards that Infinite I love, but never saw.  

From God or Satan? Angel, Mermaid, Proserpine?  
What matter if thou makest—blithe, voluptuous sprite—  
With rhythms, perfumes, visions—O mine only queen!—  
The universe less hideous and the hours less trite.</code></pre><hr>
<h3 id="exotic-perfume">Exotic Perfume</h3>
<pre><code>When, with closed eyes, on a hot afternoon,  
The scent of thine ardent breast I inhale,  
Celestial vistas my spirit assail;  
Caressed by the flames of an endless sun.  

A langorous island, where Nature abounds  
With exotic trees and luscious fruit;  
And with men whose bodies are slim and astute,  
And with women whose frankness delights and astounds.  

By thy perfume enticed to this region remote,  
A port I see, laden with mast and with boat,  
Still wearied and torn by the distant brine;  

While the tamarisk-odours that dreamily throng  
The air, round my slumberous senses intwine,  
And mix, in my soul, with the mariners&#39; song.</code></pre><hr>
<h3 id="la-chevelure">La Chevelure</h3>
<pre><code>O fleece, that foams down unto the shoulders bare!  
O curls, O scents which lovely languidness exhale!  
Delight! to fill this alcove&#39;s sombre atmosphere  
With memories, sleeping deep within this tress of hair,  
I&#39;ll wave it in the evening breezes like a veil!  

The shores of Africa, and Asia&#39;s burning skies,  
A world forgotten, distant, nearly dead and spent,  
Within thy depths, O aromatic forest! lies.  
And like to spirits floating unto melodies,  
Mine own, Belov�d! glides within thy sacred scent.  

There I will hasten, where the trees and humankind  
With languor lull beside the hot and silent sea;  
Strong tresses bear me, be to me the waves and wind!  
Within thy fragrance lies a dazzling dream confined  
Of sails and masts and flames—O lake of ebony!  

A loudly echoing harbour, where my soul may hold  
To quaff, the silver cup of colours, scents and sounds,  
Wherein the vessels glide upon a sea of gold,  
And stretch their mighty arms, the glory to enfold  
Of virgin skies, where never-ending heat abounds.  

I&#39;ll plunge my brow, enamoured with voluptuousness  
Within this darkling ocean of infinitude,  
Until my subtle spirit, which thy waves caress,  
Shall find you once again, O fertile weariness;  
Unending lullabye of perfumed lassitude!  

Ye tresses blue—recess of strange and sombre shades,  
Ye make the azure of the starry Realm immense;  
Upon the downy beeches, by your curls&#39; cascades,  
Among your mingling fragrances, my spirit wades  
To cull the musk and cocoa-nut and lotus scents.  

Long—foraye—my hand, within thy heavy mane,  
Shall scatter rubies, pearls, sapphires eternally,  
And thus my soul&#39;s desire for thee shall never wane;  
For art not thou the oasis where I dream and drain  
With draughts profound, the golden wine of memory?</code></pre><hr>

Both, deaf to mortal suffering and to strife,  
Or like the sea-weeds &#39;neath the waves that float,  
Indifferently she moulds her budding life.  

Her polished eyes are made of minerals bright,  
And in her mien, symbolical and cold,  
Wherein an angel mingles with a sphinx of old,  

Where all is gold, and steel, and gems, and light,  
There shines, just like a useless star eternally,  
The sterile woman&#39;s frigid majesty.</code></pre><hr>

<pre><code>Ah, when thou shalt slumber, my darkling love,  
Beneath a black marble-made statuette,

But a cavernous den and a damp oubliette.  

When the tomb-stone, oppressing thy timorous breast,  
And thy hips drooping sweetly with listless decay,  
The pulse and desires of mine heart shall arrest,  
And thy feet from pursuing their adventurous way,  

Then the grave, that dark friend of my limitless dreams  
(For the grave ever readeth the poet aright),  
Amid those long nights, which no slumber redeems  

&#39;Twill query—&quot;What use to thee, incomplete spright  
That thou ne&#39;er hast unfathomed the tears of the dead&quot;?—  
Then the worms will gnaw deep at thy body, like Dread.</code></pre><hr>

Oh, Mother, of Memories, Mistress of Mistresses!  

Those evenings illumed by the glow of the coal,  
And those roseate nights with their vaporous wings,  
How calm was thy breast and how good was thy soul,  
&#39;Twas then we uttered imperishable things,  
Those evenings illumed by the glow of the coal.  

How lovely the suns on those hot, autumn nights!  
How vast were the heavens! and the heart how hale!  
As I leaned towards you—oh, my Queen of Delights,  
The scent of thy blood I seemed to inhale.  
How lovely the sun on those hot, autumn nights!  

The shadows of night-time grew dense like a pall,  
And deep through the darkness thine eyes I divined,  
And I drank of thy breath—oh sweetness, oh gall,  
And thy feet in my brotherly hands reclined,  
The shadows of Night-time grew dense like a pall.  

I know how to call forth those moments so dear,  
And to live my Past—laid on thy knees—once more,  
For where should I seek for thy beauties but here  
In thy langorous heart and thy body so pure?  
I know how to call forth those moments so dear.  

Those perfumes, those infinite kisses and sighs,  
Are they born in some gulf to our plummets denied?  
Like rejuvenate suns that mount up to the skies,  
That first have been cleansed in the depths of the tide;  
Oh, perfumes! oh, infinite kisses and sighs!</code></pre><hr>

Fair dagger! burst forth from thy sheath! &#39;tis good.

Those suns that rise  
&#39;Neath erratic skies,  
——No charm could be like unto theirs—  
So strange and divine,  
Like those eyes of thine  
Which glow in the midst of their tears.  

There, all is order and loveliness,  
Luxury, calm and voluptuousness.  

The tables and chairs,  
Polished bright by the years,  
Would decorate sweetly our rooms,  
And the rarest of flowers  
Would twine round our bowers  
And mingle their amber perfumes:  
The ceilings arrayed,  
And the mirrors inlaid,  
This Eastern splendour among,  
Would furtively steal  
O&#39;er our souls, and appeal  
With its tranquillous native tongue.  

There, all is order and loveliness,  
Luxury, calm and voluptuousness.  

In the harbours, peep,  
At the vessels asleep  
(Their humour is always to roam),  
Yet it is but to grant  
Thy smallest want  
From the ends of the earth that they come,  
The sunsets beam  
Upon meadow and stream,  
And upon the city entire  
&#39;Neath a violet crest,  
The world sinks to rest,  
Illumed by a golden fire.  

There, all is order and loveliness,  
Luxury, calm and voluptuousness.</code></pre><hr>

<pre><code>You are a roseate autumn-sky, that glows!  
Yet sadness rises in me like the flood,  
And leaves in ebbing on my lips morose,  
The poignant memory of its bitter mind.  

In vain your hands my swooning breast embrace,  
Oh, friend! alone remains the plundered spot,  
Where woman&#39;s biting grip has left its trace:  
My heart, the beasts devoured—seek it not!  

My heart is a palace pillaged by the herd;  
They kill and take each other by the throat!  
A perfume glides around your bosom bared—  

O loveliness, thou scourge of souls—devote  
Thine eyes of fire—luminous-like feasts,  
To burn these rags—rejected by the beasts!</code></pre><hr>

<pre><code>Shortly we will plunge within the frigid gloom,  
Farewell swift summer brightness; all too short—  
I hear already sounding with a death-like boom  
The wood that falls upon the pavement of the court.  

The whole of winter enters in my Being—pain,  
Hate, honor, labour hard and forced—and dread,  
And like the northern sun upon its polar plane  
My heart will soon be but a stone, iced and red.  

I listen trembling unto every log that falls,  
The scaffold, which they build, has not a duller sound,  
My spirits waver, like the trembling tower walls  
that shake—with every echoing blow the builders pound.  

Meeseemeth—as to these monotonous blows I sway,  
They nail for one a coffin lid, or sound a knell—  
For whom? Autumn now—and summer yesterday!  
This strange mysterious noise betokens a farewell.

My sweet! but bitter everything to-day meseems:  
And nought—your love, the boudoir, nor the flickering blaze,  
Can replace the sun that o&#39;er the screen streams.  

And yet bemother and caress me, tender heart!  
Even me the thankless and the worthless one;  
Beloved or sister—unto me the sweets impart  
Of a glorious autumn or a sinking sun.  

Ephemeral task! the beckoning the beckoning empty tomb is set!  
Oh grant me—as upon your knees my head I lay,  
(Because the white and torrid summer I regret),  
To taste the parted season&#39;s mild and amber ray.</code></pre><hr>

<pre><code>Imagine Diana in gorgeous array,  
How into the forests and thickets she flies,  
With her hair in the breezes, and flushed for the fray,  
How the very best riders she proudly defies.  

Have you seen Th�roigne, of the blood-thirsty heart,  
As an unshod herd to attack he bestirs,  
With cheeks all inflamed, playing up to his part,  
As he goes, sword in hand, up the royal stairs?  

And so is Sisina—yet this warrior sweet,  
Has a soul with compassion and kindness replete,  
Inspired by drums and by powder, her sway  

Knows how to concede to the supplicants&#39; prayers,  
And her bosom, laid waste by the flames, has alway,  
For those that are worthy, a fountain of tears.</code></pre><hr>

A Creolean lady of unknown charms.  

Her tint, pale and warm—this bewitching bride,  
Displays a nobly nurtured mien,  
Courageous and grand like a huntsman, her stride;  
A tranquil smile and eyes serene.  

If, madam, you&#39;d go to the true land of gain,  
By the banks of the verdant Loire or the Seine,  
How worthy to garnish some pile of renown.  

You&#39;d awake in the calm of some shadowy nest,  
A thousand songs in the poet&#39;s breast,  
That your eyes would inspire far more than your brown.</code></pre><hr>

Far from the city impure and the lowering sea,

So blue and so clear and profound, like virginity?  
Oh, Agatha, tell! does thy heart not at times fly away?  

The sea, the vast ocean our travail and trouble consoles!  
What demon hath gifted the sea with a voice from on high,  
To sing us (attuned to an �olus-organ that rolls  
Forth a grumbling burden) a lenitive lullabye?  
The sea, the vast ocean our travail and trouble consoles!  

Oh, carry me, waggons, oh, sailing-ships, help me depart!  
Far, far, here the dust is quite wet with our showering tears,  
Oh, say! it is true that Agatha&#39;s desolate heart,  
Proclaimeth, &quot;Away from remorse, and from crimes, and from cares,&quot;  
Oh, carry me, waggons, oh, sailing ships, help me depart!  

How distant you seem to be, perfumed Elysian fields!  
Wherein there is nothing but sunshine and love and glee;  
Where all that one loves is so worthy, and lovingly yields,  
And our hearts float about in the purest of ecstasy,  
How distant you seem to be, perfumed Elysian fields!  

But the green paradise of those transient infantile loves,  
The strolls, and the songs, and the kisses, and bunches of flowers,  
The viols vibrating beyond, in the mountainous groves,  
With the chalice of wine and the evening, entwined, in the bowers,  
But the green paradise of those transient infantile loves.  

That innocent heaven o&#39;erflowing with furtive delight,  
Than China or India, is it still further away?  
Or, could one with pityful prayers bring it back to our sight?  
Or yet with a silvery voice o&#39;er the ages convey  
That innocent heaven o&#39;erflowing with furtive delight!</code></pre><hr>

And give thee kisses cold as the moon,  
And with a serpent&#39;s moist embrace,  
I&#39;ll crawl around thy resting-place.  

And when the livid morning falls,  
Thou&#39;lt find alone the empty walls,

Is loth its infernal depths to reveal,  
And its dissolute motto engraven with fire,  
Oh charmer! whose arms endless slumber inspire!  
I abominate passion and wit makes me ill.  

So let us love gently. Within his retreat,  
Foreboding, Love seeks for his arrows a prey,  
I know all the arms of his battle array.  

Delirium and loathing—O pale Marguerite!

Alas my so white, my so cold Marguerite!</code></pre><hr>
<h3 id="sadness-of-the-moon-goddess">Sadness of the Moon-Goddess</h3>
<pre><code>To-night the Moon dreams with increased weariness,  
Like a beauty stretched forth on a downy heap  
Of rugs, while her languorous fingers caress  
The contour of her breasts, before falling to sleep.  

On the satin back of the avalanche soft,  
She falls into lingering swoons, as she dies,  
While she lifteth her eyes to white visions aloft,  
Which like efflorescence float up to the skies.  

When at times, in her languor, down on to this sphere,  
She slyly lets trickle a furtive tear,  
A poet, desiring slumber to shun,  

Takes up this pale tear in the palm of his hand  
(The colours of which like an opal blend),  
And buries it far from the eyes of the sun.</code></pre><hr>
<h3 id="cats">Cats</h3>
<pre><code>All ardent lovers and all sages prize,  
——As ripening years incline upon their brows—  
The mild and mighty cats—pride of the house—  
That like unto them are indolent, stern and wise.  

The friends of Learning and of Ecstasy,  
They search for silence and the horrors of gloom;  
The devil had used them for his steeds of Doom,  
Could he alone have bent their pride to slavery.  

When musing, they display those outlines chaste,  
Of the great sphinxes—stretched o&#39;er the sandy waste,  
That seem to slumber deep in a dream without end:  

From out their loins a fountainous furnace flies,  
And grains of sparkling gold, as fine as sand,  
Bestar the mystic pupils of their eyes.</code></pre><hr>

<pre><code>Beneath the shades of sombre yews,  
The silent owls sit ranged in rows,

And darting fiery eyes, they muse.  

Immovable, they sit and gaze,  
Until the melancholy hour,  
At which the darknesses devour  
The faded sunset&#39;s slanting rays.  

Their attitude, instructs the wise,  
That he—within this world—who flies  
From tumult and from merriment;  

The man allured by a passing face,  
For ever bears the chastisement  
Of having wished to change his place.</code></pre><hr>

With inflated lungs and expanded chest,  
Like to a sail,  
On the backs of the heaped-up billows I rest—  
Which the shadows veil—  

I feel all the anguish within me arise  
Of a ship in distress;  
The tempest, the rain, &#39;neath the lowering skies,  

My body caress;  
At times, the calm pool or the mirror clear  
Of my despair!</code></pre><hr>
<h3 id="the-joyous-defunct">The Joyous Defunct</h3>

And sleep—quite forgotten—like a shark &#39;neath the wave.  

I hate every tomb—I abominate wills,  
And rather than tears from the world to implore,  
I would ask of the crows with their vampire bills  
To devour every bit of my carcass impure.  

Oh worms, without eyes, without ears, black friends!  
To you a defunct-one, rejoicing, descends,  
Enlivened Philosophers—offspring of Dung!  

Without any qualms, o&#39;er my wreckage spread,  
And tell if some torment there still can be wrung  
For this soul-less old frame that is dead &#39;midst the dead!</code></pre><hr>

To sounds of chimes that sing across the mist.  

Oh, happy is that bell with hearty throat,  
Which neither age nor time can e&#39;er defeat,  
Which faithfully uplifts its pious note,  
Like an ag�d soldier on his beat.  

For me, my soul is cracked, and &#39;mid her cares,  
Would often fill with her songs the midnight airs  
And oft it chances that her feeble moan  

Is like the wounded warrior&#39;s fainting groan,  
Who by a lake of blood, &#39;neath bodies slain,  
In anguish falls, and never moves again.</code></pre><hr>

And on the neighbouring outskirts of the town.  

My wasted cat, in searching for a litter,  
Bestirs its mangy paws from post to post;  
(A poet&#39;s soul that wanders in the gutter,  
With the jaded voice of a shiv&#39;ring ghost).  

The smoking pine-log, while the drone laments,  
Accompanies the wheezy pendulum,  
The while amidst a haze of dirty scents,  

——Those fatal remnants of a sick man&#39;s room—  
The gallant knave of hearts and queen of spades  
Relate their ancient amorous escapades.</code></pre><hr>

The answering echoes of your &quot;De Profundis&quot; moan.  

I hate thee, Ocean! hate thy tumults and thy throbs,  
My spirit finds them in himself. This bitter glee  
Of vanquished mortals, full of insults and of sobs,  
I hear it in the mighteous laughter of the sea.  

O starless night! thy loveliness my soul inhales,  
Without those starry rays which speak a language known,  
For I desire the dark, the naked and the lone.  

But e&#39;en those darknesses themselves to me are veils,  
Where live—and, by the millions &#39;neath my eyelids prance,  
Long, long departed Beings with familiar glance.</code></pre><hr>

——With vain desires, for ever torn  
Towards the uncertain, and the vast,  
And yet, like Ovid—I&#39;ll not mourn—  
Who from his Roman Heaven was cast.  

O heavens, turbulent as the streams,  
In you I mirror forth my pride!  
Your clouds, which clad in mourning, glide,  

Are the hearses of my dreams,  
And in your illusion lies the hell,  
Wherein my heart delights to dwell.</code></pre><hr>

Whether citizen, peasant or vagabond he,  
Be his little brain active or dull. Everywhere,  
Man feels the terror of mystery,  
And looks upon high with a glance full of fear.  

The Heaven above, that oppressive wall;  
A ceiling lit up in some lewd music hall,  
Where the actors step forth on a blood-red soil;  

The eremite&#39;s hope, and the dread of the sot,  
The Sky; that black lid of a mighty pot,  
Where, vast and minute, human Races boil.</code></pre><hr>

A something unspeakably tender and good as the night:  
O! eyes! over me your enchanting darkness let flow.  

Large eyes of my child! O Arcana profoundly adored!  
Ye resemble so closely those caves in the magical creek;  
Where within the deep slumbering shade of some petrified peak,  
There shines, undiscovered, the gems of a dazzling hoard.  

My child has got eyes so profound and so dark and so vast,  
Like thee! oh unending Night, and thy mystical shine:  
Their flames are those thoughts that with Love and with Faith combine,  
And sparkle deep down in the depths so alluring or chaste.</code></pre><hr>

Its decline, more glorious far, than a dream.  

I saw flower, furrow, and brook.... I recall  
How they swooned like a tremulous heart &#39;neath the sun,  
Let us haste to the sky-line, &#39;tis late, let us run,  
At least to catch one slanting ray ere it fall.  

But the god, who eludes me, I chase all in vain,  
The night, irresistible, plants its domain,  
Black mists and vague shivers of death it forbodes;  

While an odour of graves through the darkness spreads,  
And on the swamp&#39;s margin, my timid foot treads  
Upon slimy snails, and on unseen toads.</code></pre><hr>

&#39;Neath the lash of enjoyment, that merciless sway,  
Go plucking remorse from the menial brood,  
From them far, O my grief, hold my hand, come this way.  

Behold how they beckon, those years, long expired,  
From Heaven, in faded apparel attired,  
How Regret, smiling, foams on the waters like yeast;  

Its arches of slumber the dying sun spreads,

A stately woman passed by with hurrying feet.  

Agile and noble, with limbs of perfect poise,  
Ah, how I drank, thrilled through like a Being insane,  
In her look, a dark sky, from whence springs forth the hurricane,  
There lay but the sweetness that charms, and the joy that destroys.  

A flash—then the night.... O loveliness fugitive!  
Whose glance has so suddenly caused me again to live,  
Shall I not see you again till this life is o&#39;er!  

Elsewhere, far away ... too late, perhaps never more,

Harmonious and stately as thy footsteps move,  
Bestowing forth the languor of thy glance profound.  

When I regard thee, glowing in the gaslight rays,  
Thy pallid brow embellished by a charm obscure,  
Here where the evening torches light the twilight haze,  
Thine eyes attracting me like those of a portraiture,  

I say—How beautiful she is! how strangely rich!  
A mighty memory, royal and commanding tower,  
A garland: and her heart, bruised like a ruddy peach,  
Is ripe—like her body for Love&#39;s sapient power.  

Art thou, that spicy Autumn-fruit with taste supreme?  
Art thou a funeral vase inviting tears of grief?  
Aroma—causing one of Eastern wastes to dream;  
A downy cushion, bunch of flowers or golden sheaf?  

I know that there are eyes, most melancholy ones,  
Wherein no precious secret deeply hidden lies,  
Resplendent shrines, devoid of relics, sacred stones,  
More empty, more profound than ye yourselves, O skies?  

Yea, does thy semblance, not alone for me suffice,  
To kindle senses which the cruel truth abhor?  
All one to me! thy folly or thy heart of ice,  
Decoy or mask, all hail! thy beauty I adore!</code></pre><hr>

On that great plain, where frigid blasts abound,  
Where through the nights, so long, the vane whirls round,  
My soul, more free than in the springtime soft,  
Will stretch her raven wings and soar aloft,  

Unto an heart with gloomy things replete,  
On which remain the frosts of former Times,  
O pallid seasons, mistress of our climes

O&#39;er the blue crystal of the dawn!  

And gently balanced on the wing

Their feet towards each other stretched, their hands entwined,  
They tell of gentle yearning, frigid misery.  

A few, with heart-confiding faith of old, imbued  
Amid the darkling grove, where silver streamlets flow,  
Unfold to each their loves of tender infanthood,  
And carve the verdant stems of the vine-kissed portico.  

And others like unto nuns with footsteps slow and grave,  
Ascend the hallowed rocks of ancient mystic lore,  
Where long ago—St. Anthony, like a surging wave,  
The naked purpled breasts of his temptation saw.  

And still some more, that &#39;neath the shimmering masses stroll,  
Among the silent chasm of some pagan caves,  
To soothe their burning fevers unto thee they call  
O Bacchus! who all ancient wounds and sorrow laves.  

And others again, whose necks in scapulars delight,  
Who hide a whip beneath their garments secretly,  
Commingling, in the sombre wood and lonesome night,  
The foam of torments and of tears with ecstasy.  

O virgins, demons, monsters, and O martyred brood!  
Great souls that mock Reality with remorseless sneers,  
O saints and satyrs, searchers for infinitude!  
At times so full of shouts, at times so full of tears!  

You, to whom within your hell my spirit flies,  
Poor sisters—yea, I love you as I pity you,

And for the vials of love within your hearts so true.</code></pre><hr>

They both shall be like unto two glowing coals,  
Reflecting the twofold light of their fires  
Across the twin mirrors of our two souls.  

One evening of mystical azure skies,  
We&#39;ll exchange but one single lightning flash,  
Just like a long sob—replete with good byes.

&#39;Tis the famous inn which the guide-book shows,  
Whereat one can eat, and sleep, and recline;  

&#39;Tis an angel that holds in his magic hands  
The sleep, which ecstatic dream commands,  
Who remakes up the beds of the naked and poor;
