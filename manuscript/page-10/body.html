Upon the cursï¿½d tool of thy most wicked spite.  
Forsooth, the branches of this wretched tree I'll wound  
And rob its pestilential blossoms of their might!"  

So thus, she giveth vent unto her foaming ire,  
And knowing not the changeless statutes of all times,  
Herself, amid the flames of hell, prepares the pyre;  
The consecrated penance of maternal crimes.  

Yet 'neath th' invisible shelter of an Angel's wing  
This sunlight-loving infant disinherited,  
Exhales from all he eats and drinks, and everything  
The ever sweet ambrosia and the nectar red.
