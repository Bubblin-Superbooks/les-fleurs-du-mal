Oh, thou all my pleasures, oh, thou all my prayers!  
Can'st thou remember those luscious caresses,  
The charm of the hearth and the sweet evening airs?  
Oh, Mother, of Memories, Mistress of Mistresses!  

Those evenings illumed by the glow of the coal,  
And those roseate nights with their vaporous wings,  
How calm was thy breast and how good was thy soul,  
'Twas then we uttered imperishable things,  
Those evenings illumed by the glow of the coal.  

How lovely the suns on those hot, autumn nights!  
How vast were the heavens! and the heart how hale!  
As I leaned towards youâ€”oh, my Queen of Delights, </pre></div> </div>
