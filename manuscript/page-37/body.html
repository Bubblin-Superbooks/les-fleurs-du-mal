Within thy glance, so diabolic and divine,  
Confusedly both wickedness and goodness dwell,  
And hence one might compare thee unto sparkling wine.  

Thy look containeth both the dawn and sunset stars,  
Thy perfumes, as upon a sultry night exhale,  
Thy kiss a philter, and thy mouth a Grecian vase,  
That renders heroes cowardly and infants hale.  

Yea, art thou from the planets, or the fiery womb?  
The demon follows in thy train, with magic fraught,  
Thou scatter'st seeds haphazardly of joy and doom, </pre></div> </div>
