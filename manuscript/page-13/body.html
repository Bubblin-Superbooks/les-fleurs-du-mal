And finally to satiate my favourite beast,  
I'll throw it with intense disdain upon the ground!"  

Towards the Heavens where he sees the sacred grail  
The poet calmly stretches forth his pious arms,  
Whereon the lightenings from his lucid spirit veil  
The sight of the infuriated mob that swarms.  

"Oh blest be thou, Almighty who bestowest pain,  
Like some divine redress for our infirmities,  
And like the most refreshing and the purest rain,  
To sanctify the strong, for saintly ecstasies."  

"I know that for the poet thou wilt grant a chair,  
Among the Sainted Legion and the Blissful ones,  
That of the endless feast thou wilt accord his share  
To him, of Virtues, Dominations and of Thrones." </pre></div> </div>
