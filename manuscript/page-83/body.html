Oh, say! it is true that Agatha's desolate heart,  
Proclaimeth, "Away from remorse, and from crimes, and from cares,"  
Oh, carry me, waggons, oh, sailing ships, help me depart!

And our hearts float about in the purest of ecstasy,  
How distant you seem to be, perfumed Elysian fields!  

But the green paradise of those transient infantile loves, </pre></div> </div>
