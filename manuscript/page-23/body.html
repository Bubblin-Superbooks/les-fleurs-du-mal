<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><h3>The Enemy</h3><pre class="  "><code>My childhood was nought but a ravaging storm,  
Enlivened at times by a brilliant sun;  
The rain and the winds wrought such havoc and harm  
That of buds on my plot there remains hardly one.  

Behold now the Fall of ideas I have reached,  
And the shovel and rake one must therefore resume,  
In collecting the turf, inundated and breached,  
Where the waters dug trenches as deep as a tomb.  

And yet these new blossoms, for which I craved,  
Will they find in this earth—like a shore that is laved—  
The mystical fuel which vigour imparts?  

Oh misery!—Time devours our lives, </pre></div> </div>
