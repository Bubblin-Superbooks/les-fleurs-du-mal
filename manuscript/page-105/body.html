Tormented like thy destiny,  
What thoughts within thy spirit range  
Themselves?—O libertine reply."  

——With vain desires, for ever torn  
Towards the uncertain, and the vast,  
And yet, like Ovid—I'll not mourn—  
Who from his Roman Heaven was cast.  

O heavens, turbulent as the streams,  
In you I mirror forth my pride!  
Your clouds, which clad in mourning, glide,  

Are the hearses of my dreams, </pre></div> </div>
