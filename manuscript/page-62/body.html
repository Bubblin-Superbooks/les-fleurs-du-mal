<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><h3>The Spiritual Dawn</h3><pre class="  "><code>When the morning white and rosy breaks,  
With the gnawing Ideal, upon the debauchee,  
By the power of a strange decree,  
Within the sotted beast an Angel wakes.  

The mental Heaven's inaccessible blue,  
For wearied mortals that still dream and mourn,  
Expands and sinks; towards the chasm drawn.  
Thus, cherished goddess, Being pure and trueâ€”  

Upon the rests of foolish orgy-nights  
Thine image, more sublime, more pink, more clear,  
Before my staring eyes is ever there.  

The sun has darkened all the candle lights; </pre></div> </div>
