When all transports me with delight,  
If aught deludes I can not know,  
She either lulls one like the Night,  
Or dazzles like the Morning-glow.  

That harmony is too divine,  
Which governs all her body fair,  
For powerless mortals to define  
In notes the many concords there.  

O mystic metamorphosis  
Of all my senses blent in one!  
Her voice a beauteous perfume is,  
Her breath makes music, chaste and wan.</code></pre><hr class="section"></div> </div>
