<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><h3>I</h3><pre class="  "><code>Shortly we will plunge within the frigid gloom,  
Farewell swift summer brightness; all too short—  
I hear already sounding with a death-like boom  
The wood that falls upon the pavement of the court.  

The whole of winter enters in my Being—pain,  
Hate, honor, labour hard and forced—and dread,  
And like the northern sun upon its polar plane  
My heart will soon be but a stone, iced and red.  

I listen trembling unto every log that falls,  
The scaffold, which they build, has not a duller sound,  
My spirits waver, like the trembling tower walls  
that shake—with every echoing blow the builders pound. </pre></div> </div>
