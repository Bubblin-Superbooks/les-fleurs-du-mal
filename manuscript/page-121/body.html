<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><h3>The Wine Of Lovers</h3><pre class="  "><code>To-day the Distance is superb,  
Without bridle, spur or curb,  
Let us mount on the back of wine  
For Regions fairy and divine!  

Let's, like two angels tortured by  
Some dark, delirious phantasy,  
Pursue the distant mirage drawn  
O'er the blue crystal of the dawn!  

And gently balanced on the wing  
Of some obliging whirlwind, we  
——In equal rapture revelling—  

My sister, side by side will flee, </pre></div> </div>
