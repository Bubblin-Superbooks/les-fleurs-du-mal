With paintings, the Beatic Verity,  
The which—adorning their religious halls,  
Enriched the frigidness of their Austerity.  

In days when Christian seeds bloomed o'er the land,  
Full many a noble monk unknown to-day,  
Upon the field of tombs would take his stand,  
Exalting Death in rude and simple way.  

My soul is a tomb where—bad monk that I be—  
I dwell and search its depths from all eternity,  
And nought bedecks the walls of the odious spot.  

Oh sluggard monk! when shall I glean aright </pre></div> </div>
