Within thy fragrance lies a dazzling dream confined  
Of sails and masts and flames—O lake of ebony!  

A loudly echoing harbour, where my soul may hold  
To quaff, the silver cup of colours, scents and sounds,  
Wherein the vessels glide upon a sea of gold,  
And stretch their mighty arms, the glory to enfold  
Of virgin skies, where never-ending heat abounds.  

I'll plunge my brow, enamoured with voluptuousness  
Within this darkling ocean of infinitude,  
Until my subtle spirit, which thy waves caress,  
Shall find you once again, O fertile weariness;  
Unending lullabye of perfumed lassitude!  

Ye tresses blue—recess of strange and sombre shades,  
Ye make the azure of the starry Realm immense; </pre></div> </div>
