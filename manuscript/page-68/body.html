Consider how fair,  
Together to live it would be!  
Down yonder to fly  
To love, till we die,  
In the land which resembles thee.  
Those suns that rise  
'Neath erratic skies,  
——No charm could be like unto theirs—  
So strange and divine,  
Like those eyes of thine  
Which glow in the midst of their tears.  

There, all is order and loveliness,  
Luxury, calm and voluptuousness. </pre></div> </div>
