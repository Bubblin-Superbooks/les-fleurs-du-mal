The naked purpled breasts of his temptation saw.  

And still some more, that 'neath the shimmering masses stroll,  
Among the silent chasm of some pagan caves,  
To soothe their burning fevers unto thee they call  
O Bacchus! who all ancient wounds and sorrow laves.  

And others again, whose necks in scapulars delight,  
Who hide a whip beneath their garments secretly,  
Commingling, in the sombre wood and lonesome night,  
The foam of torments and of tears with ecstasy.  

O virgins, demons, monsters, and O martyred brood!  
Great souls that mock Reality with remorseless sneers,  
O saints and satyrs, searchers for infinitude! </pre></div> </div>
