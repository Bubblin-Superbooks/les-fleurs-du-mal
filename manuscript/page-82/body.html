<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><h3>Moesta Et Errabunda</h3><pre class="  "><code>Oh, Agatha, tell! does thy heart not at times fly away?  
Far from the city impure and the lowering sea,  
To another ocean that blinds with its dazzling array,  
So blue and so clear and profound, like virginity?  
Oh, Agatha, tell! does thy heart not at times fly away?  

The sea, the vast ocean our travail and trouble consoles!  
What demon hath gifted the sea with a voice from on high,  
To sing us (attuned to an ï¿½olus-organ that rolls  
Forth a grumbling burden) a lenitive lullabye?  
The sea, the vast ocean our travail and trouble consoles!  

Oh, carry me, waggons, oh, sailing-ships, help me depart! </pre></div> </div>
