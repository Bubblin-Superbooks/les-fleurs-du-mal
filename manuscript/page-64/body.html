<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><h3>Evening Harmony</h3><pre class="  "><code>The hour approacheth, when, as their stems incline,  
The flowers evaporate like an incense urn,  
And sounds and scents in the vesper breezes turn;  
A melancholy waltz—and a drowsiness divine.  

The flowers evaporate like an incense urn,  
The viol vibrates like the wailing of souls that repine.  
A melancholy waltz—and a drowsiness divine,  
The skies like a mosque are beautiful and stern.  

The viol vibrates like the wailing of souls that repine;  
Sweet souls that shrink from chaos vast and etern,  
The skies like a mosque are beautiful and stern,  
The sunset drowns within its blood-red brine. </pre></div> </div>
