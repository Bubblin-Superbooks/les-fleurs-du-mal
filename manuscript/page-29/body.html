The sea is thy mirror, thou regardest thy soul  
In its mighteous waves that unendingly roll,  
And thy spirit is yet not a chasm less drear.  

Thou delight'st to plunge deep in thine image down;  
Thou tak'st it with eyes and with arms in embrace,  
And at times thine own inward voice would'st efface  
With the sound of its savage ungovernable moan.  

You are both of you, sombre, secretive and deep:  
Oh mortal, thy depths are foraye unexplored,  
Oh seaâ€”no one knoweth thy dazzling hoard,  
You both are so jealous your secrets to keep! </pre></div> </div>
