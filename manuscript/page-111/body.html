Like an explosion that greets us from above,  
Oh, happy is he that can hail with love,  
Its decline, more glorious far, than a dream.  

I saw flower, furrow, and brook.... I recall  
How they swooned like a tremulous heart 'neath the sun,  
Let us haste to the sky-line, 'tis late, let us run,  
At least to catch one slanting ray ere it fall.  

But the god, who eludes me, I chase all in vain,  
The night, irresistible, plants its domain,  
Black mists and vague shivers of death it forbodes; </pre></div> </div>
