<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><h3>Ii</h3><pre class="  "><code>I love within your oblong eyes the verdant rays,  
My sweet! but bitter everything to-day meseems:  
And nought—your love, the boudoir, nor the flickering blaze,  
Can replace the sun that o'er the screen streams.  

And yet bemother and caress me, tender heart!  
Even me the thankless and the worthless one;  
Beloved or sister—unto me the sweets impart  
Of a glorious autumn or a sinking sun.  

Ephemeral task! the beckoning the beckoning empty tomb is set!  
Oh grant me—as upon your knees my head I lay,  
(Because the white and torrid summer I regret), </pre></div> </div>
