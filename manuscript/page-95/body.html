<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><h3>Music</h3><pre class="  "><code>Oft Music possesses me like the seas!  
To my planet pale,  
'Neath a ceiling of mist, in the lofty breeze,  
I set my sail.  

With inflated lungs and expanded chest,  
Like to a sail,  
On the backs of the heaped-up billows I rest—  
Which the shadows veil—  

I feel all the anguish within me arise  
Of a ship in distress;  
The tempest, the rain, 'neath the lowering skies,  

My body caress; </pre></div> </div>
