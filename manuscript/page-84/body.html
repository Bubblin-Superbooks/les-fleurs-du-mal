The strolls, and the songs, and the kisses, and bunches of flowers,  
The viols vibrating beyond, in the mountainous groves,  
With the chalice of wine and the evening, entwined, in the bowers,  
But the green paradise of those transient infantile loves.  

That innocent heaven o'erflowing with furtive delight,  
Than China or India, is it still further away?  
Or, could one with pityful prayers bring it back to our sight?  
Or yet with a silvery voice o'er the ages convey  
That innocent heaven o'erflowing with furtive delight!</code></pre><hr class="section"></div> </div>
