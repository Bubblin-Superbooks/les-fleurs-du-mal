"I know, that Sorrow is that nobleness alone,  
Which never may corrupted be by hell nor curse,  
I know, in order to enwreathe my mystic crown  
I must inspire the ages and the universe."  

"And yet the buried jewels of Palmyra old,  
The undiscovered metals and the pearly sea  
Of gems, that unto me you show could never hold  
Beside this diadem of blinding brilliancy."  

"For it shall be engendered from the purest fire  
Of rays primeval, from the holy hearth amassed,  
Of which the eyes of Mortals, in their sheen entire,  
Are but the tarnished mirrors, sad and overcast!"</code></pre><hr class="section"></div> </div>
