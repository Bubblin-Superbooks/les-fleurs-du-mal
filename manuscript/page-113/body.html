Thou didst call for the night, and behold it is here,  
An atmosphere sombre, envelopes the town,  
To some bringing peace and to others a care.  

Whilst the manifold souls of the vile multitude,  
'Neath the lash of enjoyment, that merciless sway,  
Go plucking remorse from the menial brood,  
From them far, O my grief, hold my hand, come this way.  

Behold how they beckon, those years, long expired,  
From Heaven, in faded apparel attired,  
How Regret, smiling, foams on the waters like yeast; </pre></div> </div>
