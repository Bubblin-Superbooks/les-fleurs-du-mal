<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><h3>Illusionary Love</h3><pre class="  "><code>When I behold thee wander by, my languorous love,  
To songs of viols which throughout the dome resound,  
Harmonious and stately as thy footsteps move,  
Bestowing forth the languor of thy glance profound.  

When I regard thee, glowing in the gaslight rays,  
Thy pallid brow embellished by a charm obscure,  
Here where the evening torches light the twilight haze,  
Thine eyes attracting me like those of a portraiture,  

I say—How beautiful she is! how strangely rich!  
A mighty memory, royal and commanding tower,  
A garland: and her heart, bruised like a ruddy peach,  
Is ripe—like her body for Love's sapient power. </pre></div> </div>
