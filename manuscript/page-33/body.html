<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><h3>The Ideal</h3><pre class="  "><code>It could ne'er be those beauties of ivory vignettes;  
The varied display of a worthless age,  
Nor puppet-like figures with castonets,  
That ever an heart like mine could engage.  

I leave to Gavarni, that poet of chlorosis,  
His hospital-beauties in troups that whirl,  
For I cannot discover amid his pale roses  
A flower to resemble my scarlet ideal.  

Since, what for this fathomless heart I require  
Is—Lady Macbeth you! in crime so dire;  
——An �schylus dream transposed from the South—  

Or thee, oh great "Night" of Michael-Angelo born, </pre></div> </div>
