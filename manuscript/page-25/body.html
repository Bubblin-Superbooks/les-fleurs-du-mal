<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><h3>Ill Luck</h3><pre class="  "><code>This heavy burden to uplift,  
O Sysiphus, thy pluck is required!  
And even though the heart aspired,  
Art is long and Time is swift.  

Afar from sepulchres renowned,  
To a graveyard, quite apart,  
Like a broken drum, my heart,  
Beats the funeral marches' sound.  

Many a buried jewel sleeps  
In the long-forgotten deeps,  
Far from mattock and from sound;  

Many a flower wafts aloft </pre></div> </div>
