The scent of thy blood I seemed to inhale.  
How lovely the sun on those hot, autumn nights!  

The shadows of night-time grew dense like a pall,  
And deep through the darkness thine eyes I divined,  
And I drank of thy breath—oh sweetness, oh gall,  
And thy feet in my brotherly hands reclined,  
The shadows of Night-time grew dense like a pall.  

I know how to call forth those moments so dear,  
And to live my Past—laid on thy knees—once more,  
For where should I seek for thy beauties but here  
In thy langorous heart and thy body so pure?  
I know how to call forth those moments so dear.  

Those perfumes, those infinite kisses and sighs,  
Are they born in some gulf to our plummets denied? </pre></div> </div>
