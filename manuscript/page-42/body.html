O curls, O scents which lovely languidness exhale!  
Delight! to fill this alcove's sombre atmosphere  
With memories, sleeping deep within this tress of hair,  
I'll wave it in the evening breezes like a veil!  

The shores of Africa, and Asia's burning skies,  
A world forgotten, distant, nearly dead and spent,  
Within thy depths, O aromatic forest! lies.  
And like to spirits floating unto melodies,  
Mine own, Belovï¿½d! glides within thy sacred scent.  

There I will hasten, where the trees and humankind  
With languor lull beside the hot and silent sea;  
Strong tresses bear me, be to me the waves and wind! </pre></div> </div>
