<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><h3>The Lid</h3><pre class="  "><code>Where'er he may rove, upon sea or on land,  
'Neath a fiery sky or a pallid sun,  
Be he Christian or one of Cythera's band,  
Opulent Croesus or beggarâ€”'tis one,  

Whether citizen, peasant or vagabond he,  
Be his little brain active or dull. Everywhere,  
Man feels the terror of mystery,  
And looks upon high with a glance full of fear.  

The Heaven above, that oppressive wall;  
A ceiling lit up in some lewd music hall,  
Where the actors step forth on a blood-red soil;  

The eremite's hope, and the dread of the sot, </pre></div> </div>
