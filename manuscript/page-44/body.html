Upon the downy beeches, by your curls' cascades,  
Among your mingling fragrances, my spirit wades  
To cull the musk and cocoa-nut and lotus scents.  

Long—foraye—my hand, within thy heavy mane,  
Shall scatter rubies, pearls, sapphires eternally,  
And thus my soul's desire for thee shall never wane;  
For art not thou the oasis where I dream and drain  
With draughts profound, the golden wine of memory?</code></pre><hr class="section"></div> </div>
