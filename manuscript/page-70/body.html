In the harbours, peep,  
At the vessels asleep  
(Their humour is always to roam),  
Yet it is but to grant  
Thy smallest want  
From the ends of the earth that they come,  
The sunsets beam  
Upon meadow and stream,  
And upon the city entire  
'Neath a violet crest,  
The world sinks to rest,  
Illumed by a golden fire.  

There, all is order and loveliness,  
Luxury, calm and voluptuousness.</code></pre><hr class="section"></div> </div>
