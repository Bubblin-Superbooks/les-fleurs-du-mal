Thine eyes are bedimmed with the visions of Night,  
And silent and cold—I perceive on thy brow  
In their turns—Despair and Madness alight.  

A succubus green, or a hobgoblin red,  
Has it poured o'er thee Horror and Love from its urn?  
Or the Nightmare with masterful bearing hath led  
Thee to drown in the depths of some magic Minturne?  

I wish, as the health-giving fragrance I cull,  
That thy breast with strong thoughts could for ever be full,  
And that rhymthmic'ly flowing—thy Christian blood </pre></div> </div>
