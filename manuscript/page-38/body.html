Thou govern'st everything, but answer'st unto nought.  

O Loveliness! thou spurnest corpses with delight,  
Among thy jewels, Horror hath such charms for thee,  
And Murder 'mid thy mostly cherished trinklets bright,  
Upon thy massive bosom dances amorously.  

The blinded, fluttering moth towards the candle flies,  
Then frizzles, falls, and falters—"Blessings unto thee"—  
The panting swain that o'er his beauteous mistress sighs,  
Seems like the Sick, that stroke their gravestones lovingly.  

What matter, if thou comest from the Heavens or Hell,  
O Beauty, frightful ghoul, ingenuous and obscure!  
So long thine eyes, thy smile, to me the way can tell </pre></div> </div>
