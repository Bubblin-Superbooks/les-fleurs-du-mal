<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><h3>The Joyous Defunct</h3><pre class="  "><code>Where snails abound—in a juicy soil,  
I will dig for myself a fathomless grave,  
Where at leisure mine ancient bones I can coil,  
And sleep—quite forgotten—like a shark 'neath the wave.  

I hate every tomb—I abominate wills,  
And rather than tears from the world to implore,  
I would ask of the crows with their vampire bills  
To devour every bit of my carcass impure.  

Oh worms, without eyes, without ears, black friends!  
To you a defunct-one, rejoicing, descends,  
Enlivened Philosophers—offspring of Dung! </pre></div> </div>
