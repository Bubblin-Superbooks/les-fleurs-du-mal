<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><h3>The Broken Bell</h3><pre class="  "><code>How sweet and bitter, on a winter night,  
Beside the palpitating fire to list,  
As, slowly, distant memories alight,  
To sounds of chimes that sing across the mist.  

Oh, happy is that bell with hearty throat,  
Which neither age nor time can e'er defeat,  
Which faithfully uplifts its pious note,  
Like an agï¿½d soldier on his beat.  

For me, my soul is cracked, and 'mid her cares,  
Would often fill with her songs the midnight airs  
And oft it chances that her feeble moan  

Is like the wounded warrior's fainting groan, </pre></div> </div>
