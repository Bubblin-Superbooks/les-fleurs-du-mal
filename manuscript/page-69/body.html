The tables and chairs,  
Polished bright by the years,  
Would decorate sweetly our rooms,  
And the rarest of flowers  
Would twine round our bowers  
And mingle their amber perfumes:  
The ceilings arrayed,  
And the mirrors inlaid,  
This Eastern splendour among,  
Would furtively steal  
O'er our souls, and appeal  
With its tranquillous native tongue.  

There, all is order and loveliness,  
Luxury, calm and voluptuousness. </pre></div> </div>
