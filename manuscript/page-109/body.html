O! beautiful childish eyes there abounds in your light,  
A something unspeakably tender and good as the night:  
O! eyes! over me your enchanting darkness let flow.  

Large eyes of my child! O Arcana profoundly adored!  
Ye resemble so closely those caves in the magical creek;  
Where within the deep slumbering shade of some petrified peak,  
There shines, undiscovered, the gems of a dazzling hoard.  

My child has got eyes so profound and so dark and so vast, </pre></div> </div>
