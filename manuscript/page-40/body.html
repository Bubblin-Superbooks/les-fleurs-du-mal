The scent of thine ardent breast I inhale,  
Celestial vistas my spirit assail;  
Caressed by the flames of an endless sun.  

A langorous island, where Nature abounds  
With exotic trees and luscious fruit;  
And with men whose bodies are slim and astute,  
And with women whose frankness delights and astounds.  

By thy perfume enticed to this region remote,  
A port I see, laden with mast and with boat,  
Still wearied and torn by the distant brine; </pre></div> </div>
