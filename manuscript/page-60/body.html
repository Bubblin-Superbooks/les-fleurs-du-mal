No doubt inspired by an Angel wise;  
They stand, those God-like brothers that are mine,  
And pour their diamond fires in mine eyes.  

From all transgressions, from all snares, they save,  
Towards the Path of Joy they guide my ways;  
They are my servants, and I am their slave;  
And all my soul, this living torch obeys.  

Ye charming Eyesâ€”ye have those mystic beams,  
Of candles, burning in full day; the sun  
Awakes, yet kills not their fantastic gleams:  

Ye sing the Awak'ning, they the dark oblivion; </pre></div> </div>
