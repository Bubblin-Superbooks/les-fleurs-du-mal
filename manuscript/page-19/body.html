Wilt have—when New Year speeds its wintry blast,  
Amid those tedious nights, with snow o'ercast,  
A log to warm thy feet, benumbed with cold?  

Wilt thou thy marbled shoulders then revive  
With nightly rays that through thy shutters peep?  
And—void thy purse and void thy palace—reap  
A golden hoard within some azure hive?  

Thou must, to earn thy daily bread, each night,  
Suspend the censer like an acolyte,  
Te-Deums sing, with sanctimonious ease,  

Or as a famished mountebank, with jokes obscene </pre></div> </div>
