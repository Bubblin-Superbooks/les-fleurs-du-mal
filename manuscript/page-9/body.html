<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><h3>Benediction</h3><pre class="  "><code>When by the changeless Power of a Supreme Decree  
The poet issues forth upon this sorry sphere,  
His mother, horrified, and full of blasphemy,  
Uplifts her voice to God, who takes compassion on her.  

"Ah, why did I not bear a serpent's nest entire,  
Instead of bringing forth this hideous Child of Doom!  
Oh cursï¿½d be that transient night of vain desire  
When I conceived my expiation in my womb!"  

"Yet since among all women thou hast chosen me  
To be the degradation of my jaded mate,  
And since I cannot like a love-leaf wantonly  
Consign this stunted monster to the glowing grate," </pre></div> </div>
