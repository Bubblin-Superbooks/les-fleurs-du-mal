Art thou, that spicy Autumn-fruit with taste supreme?  
Art thou a funeral vase inviting tears of grief?  
Aromaâ€”causing one of Eastern wastes to dream;  
A downy cushion, bunch of flowers or golden sheaf?  

I know that there are eyes, most melancholy ones,  
Wherein no precious secret deeply hidden lies,  
Resplendent shrines, devoid of relics, sacred stones,  
More empty, more profound than ye yourselves, O skies?  

Yea, does thy semblance, not alone for me suffice,  
To kindle senses which the cruel truth abhor?  
All one to me! thy folly or thy heart of ice,  
Decoy or mask, all hail! thy beauty I adore!</code></pre><hr class="section"></div> </div>
