At times so full of shouts, at times so full of tears!  

You, to whom within your hell my spirit flies,  
Poor sistersâ€”yea, I love you as I pity you,  
For your unsatiated thirsts and anguished sighs,  
And for the vials of love within your hearts so true.</code></pre><hr class="section"></div> </div>
